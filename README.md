# Columns

*Note. Currently, this implementation of Columns only works on the command line or Terminal. I plan to add a GUI version of this game via PyGame in the near future.

Columns is a game played quite similarily to Tetris. The basic objective of the game is to last as long as possible. The game ends when the game board is too full to make any other moves. While Tetris is based on row-matching and uses different unique shapes as 'Fallers', Columns uses "3-piece Columns" and is played with vertical, horizontal, and diagonal matching.

To play the game:
  1. Answer the initial game prompts with desired number of rows and columns for the size of the game board. 
  2. To simulate the passing of time, simply press enter without inputting any text to drop the faller by 1 row. 
  3. To move a faller left or right, input "<" for left and ">" for right. 
  4. To rotate the colors/pieces of a faller, input "R". 
  5. Input "Q" to quit the game
  
This project was originally based off of a University assignment, but I modified it to make it feel more like a playable game. Working on this project was the first time I fully understood abd experienced the importance of Object-Oriented Programming and the organization. It was this project where my days of writing spaghetti code came to an end!
